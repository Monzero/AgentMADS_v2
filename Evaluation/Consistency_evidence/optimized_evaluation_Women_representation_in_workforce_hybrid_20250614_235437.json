      "answer": "=== FROM annual_report_url.pdf ===\nThe most up-to-date and authoritative source for the percentage of women in Tata Motors' total workforce for fiscal year 2023 is page 98 of the `annual_report_url.pdf`.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nWhile multiple sources mention the percentage of women in the workforce, page 98 provides a clear breakdown of the employee composition as of March 31, 2024, showing 11.1% women in the total workforce, which includes permanent and contractual employees.  The other documents provide either older data or don't give a total workforce number in their summary of women's representation.  Therefore, data from page 98 provides the most current figure that can be used to answer the question and  is more likely to be up-to-date and authoritative.",

      "answer": "The percentage of women in the total workforce, as reported on page 96 of the provided document, is 11.1%.  However, whether this is the most up-to-date and reliable data for fiscal year 2023 cannot be definitively confirmed from the provided text.  The report states that the data is from their latest survey conducted in 2024, reflecting employee buy-in to their cultural transformation efforts in that year, which suggests that the 11.1% figure may reflect a later period than fiscal year 2023.  More information would be needed to confirm whether this is the most up-to-date and reliable data specifically for fiscal year 2023.\n\n\nSources: pp. 97-99 (annual_report_url.pdf); pp. 3-5 (cg_report.pdf); pp. 1-3 (credit_rating.pdf); pp. 160-162 (combined_policies.pdf)",

Evidence 3 states that the percentage is 11.1%,  but also raises a caveat that this data may reflect a later period than fiscal year 2023 because the report states it's from a 2024 survey.  Evidence 2 mentions that the same page (98) shows 11.1% women in the total workforce, this time explicitly stating that it includes both permanent and contractual employees.  While there's ambiguity regarding whether this precise 11.1% figure is strictly for fiscal year 2023, the figure falls within the 10-30% range specified for a score of 1 in the rubric.  Evidence 1 mentions approximately 11% from page 12 of \"Tata Motors Limited_October 07_2024_RR_352635.html\", further supporting the 10-30% range.  Therefore, considering the available evidence, a score of 1 is assigned. Sources: pp. 96-98 (annual_report_url.pdf); pp. 12 (Tata Motors Limited_October 07_2024_RR_352635.html)",
