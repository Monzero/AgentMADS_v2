This information is found on page 96 of the 79th Integrated Annual Report 2023-24."".  Since 11.1% falls within the range of 10% to 30%, the scoring rubric assigns a score of 1."

This percentage falls within the range of 10% to 30%, as defined in the scoring rubric for a score of 1. The source cited is page 12 of the provided document. Note that while multiple page numbers are listed in the source section of the evidence,  the answer specifically references page 12.  Therefore, the score of 1 is justified based on this information."

Evidence 3 states that the percentage is 11.1%,  but also raises a caveat that this data may reflect a later period than fiscal year 2023 because the report states it's from a 2024 survey.  Evidence 2 mentions that the same page (98) shows 11.1% women in the total workforce, this time explicitly stating that it includes both permanent and contractual employees.  While there's ambiguity regarding whether this precise 11.1% figure is strictly for fiscal year 2023, the figure falls within the 10-30% range specified for a score of 1 in the rubric.  Evidence 1 mentions approximately 11% from page 12 of ""Tata Motors Limited_October 07_2024_RR_352635.html"", further supporting the 10-30% range.  Therefore, considering the available evidence, a score of 1 is assigned. Sources: pp. 96-98 (annual_report_url.pdf); pp. 12 (Tata Motors Limited_October 07_2024_RR_352635.html)"

This percentage falls within the range of 10% to 30%, which corresponds to a score of 1 according to the provided scoring rubric.  While the exact numbers of female and total employees are not given, the reported percentage is sufficient for scoring.  Other sources were consulted, but only cg_report.pdf (page 12) provided the relevant data."

This information is found on page 96 of the provided document.""  This falls within the rubric's definition of a score of 1 (10% to 30%). The source is cited as page 96 of an unspecified document. While the provided source list includes several documents and page numbers (pp. 97-99 (annual_report_url.pdf); pp. 2-4 (credit_rating.pdf); pp. 3-5 (cg_report.pdf); pp. 172-174 (combined_policies.pdf) and Page 98 (annual_report_url.pdf), Page 3 (credit_rating.pdf), Page 4 (cg_report.pdf), Page 173 (combined_policies.pdf)), the answer explicitly points to page 96 as the source of the 11.1% figure.  There's a discrepancy between the answer's page number (96) and the list of sources (which doesn't directly include page 96, but does include a range that encompasses it), which impacts the evidence quality slightly.  However, given the information provided, 11.1% clearly fits into the 10-30% range."
