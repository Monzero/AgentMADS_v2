    "justification": "The evidence states that \"The percentage of women in the total workforce at Tata Motors is 11.1%. This information is found on page 96 of the provided document.\"  This falls within the rubric's definition of a score of 1 (10% to 30%). The source is cited as page 96 of an unspecified document. While the provided source list includes several documents and page numbers (pp. 97-99 (annual_report_url.pdf); pp. 2-4 (credit_rating.pdf); pp. 3-5 (cg_report.pdf); pp. 172-174 (combined_policies.pdf) and Page 98 (annual_report_url.pdf), Page 3 (credit_rating.pdf), Page 4 (cg_report.pdf), Page 173 (combined_policies.pdf)), the answer explicitly points to page 96 as the source of the 11.1% figure.  There's a discrepancy between the answer's page number (96) and the list of sources (which doesn't directly include page 96, but does include a range that encompasses it), which impacts the evidence quality slightly.  However, given the information provided, 11.1% clearly fits into the 10-30% range.",
