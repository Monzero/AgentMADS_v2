This you can typically find in annual report. Then you need to check the AGM date. AGM date is typically found on notice section of annual report. It is either on first few pages or last few pages of the annual report. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information. Calculate the gap between financial year end date and AGM date. And answer whether this gap is less than 4 months, between 4 to 6 months or more than 6 months.",
