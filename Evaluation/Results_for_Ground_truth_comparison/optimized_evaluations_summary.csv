Pages 3 and 5 of combined_policies.pdf detail the processes for identifying related parties and transactions, and the authorization process involving the Audit Committee and Board of Directors, including thresholds for shareholder approval and procedures for omnibus approvals.  Page 3 of combined_policies.pdf outlines the policy's mandate for disclosures as per SEBI Listing Regulations and other laws.  Furthermore, page 4 of combined_policies.pdf highlights the Audit Committee's role in reviewing related party transactions and the policy's requirement for ongoing review and amendment.  The policy's emphasis on preventing conflicts of interest, ensuring independent valuations, and promoting transparency in authorization and disclosure is further supported by specific examples and details across multiple pages in the cited documents.  For example, page 3 of combined_policies.pdf describes the process for seeking external professional opinions for valuations. Page 5 of combined_policies.pdf outlines specific criteria for omnibus approvals. Page 8 of combined_policies.pdf mandates comprehensive disclosure. The consistent references to procedures and responsibilities across multiple documents (combined_policies.pdf, cg_report.pdf, annual_report_url.pdf, credit_rating.pdf)  further strengthens the evidence of a comprehensive and well-defined policy."
