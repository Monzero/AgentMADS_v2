    "guidance": "You have to look for two dates. One for financial year end date and second for AGM date. Financial year end date is usually 31st March, but it can be different for some companies. This you can typically find in annual report. Then you need to check the AGM date. AGM date is typically found on notice section of annual report. It is either on first few pages or last few pages of the annual report. Make sure you quote this source in the answer with the page number from which you extract the information. Calculate the gap between financial year end date and AGM date. And answer whether this gap is less than 4 months, between 4 to 6 months or more than 6 months.",

    "justification": "Both Evidence 1 and Evidence 2 consistently state that the financial year-end date is March 31st, 2024 (Page 1, annual_report_url.pdf), and the AGM date is June 24th, 2024 (Page 1, annual_report_url.pdf).  The number of days between these dates is calculated as 85 days.  This translates to approximately 2.8 months (85 days / 30 days per month \u2248 2.8 months).  Since 2.8 months is less than 4 months, it falls under the rubric's 'between 4 to 6 months' category. However, the calculation is based on an approximation of 30 days per month. A more precise calculation considering the actual number of days in each month results in 85 days, which is still between 2 and 3 months. As 85 days is between 4-6 months,  the score is 1.
