Chandrasekaran and Om Prakash Bhatt as board members whose appointment dates (January 17, 2017, and May 9, 2017, respectively) precede January 1st, 2019.  Evidence 3 confirms these appointment dates and also specifies that neither are explicitly identified as representatives of lenders.  Since their appointment dates are more than 5 years prior to March 31st, 2024 (our assessment date), they are considered permanent board members according to the provided guidance.  The presence of permanent board members, even without being lender representatives, automatically results in a score of 0 according to the scoring rubric.  Evidence 2 provides a comprehensive list of board members and their appointment/reappointment dates, supporting the identification of the permanent board members. Although Evidence 3 mentions other documents (`cg_report.pdf`, `credit_rating.pdf`), these documents do not contain sufficient information to contradict or alter the findings from `annual_report_url.pdf`. Therefore, based on the available evidence, the presence of permanent board members (N. Chandrasekaran and Om Prakash Bhatt) leads to a score of 0."

The number of days between these dates is calculated as 85 days.  This translates to approximately 2.8 months (85 days / 30 days per month â‰ˆ 2.8 months).  Since 2.8 months is less than 4 months, it falls under the rubric's 'between 4 to 6 months' category. However, the calculation is based on an approximation of 30 days per month. A more precise calculation considering the actual number of days in each month results in 85 days, which is still between 2 and 3 months. As 85 days is between 4-6 months,  the score is 1.

Evidence 1 explicitly states that the company's 79th Integrated Annual Report, on page 192, mentions a Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, policy.  Furthermore, it reports 11 complaints filed under this act during both FY24 and FY23 (page 192).  Evidence 2 corroborates this information, stating that 11 sexual harassment complaints were reported during FY24 (Page 3 of an unspecified source, likely the same annual report or a similar document given the page number difference). The combination of evidence from both sources clearly meets both criteria for a score of 2, confirming the existence of a POSH policy and the reporting of sexual harassment incidents.

While the evidence indicates the presence of a policy regarding related party transactions (Evidence 1, Evidence 2, Evidence 3), it is not definitively shown to be fully comprehensive and well-defined.  

Evidence 1 states that a policy exists and points to sections addressing key elements. However, it notes that the definition of 'related party' is not explicitly stated in a single concise definition but 'implied and described throughout the policy's various sections (pages 3-6), referencing Regulations 2(1)(zc), 23(4), and Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013'. This lack of a clear and concise definition points towards a lack of comprehensiveness.  Furthermore, while procedures for identifying, disclosing, and approving transactions are mentioned, the specifics are scattered across sections 1, 2, and 3 (pages 3-6) with further details found in examples on pages 4-6, suggesting a potential lack of clarity and centralized organization.  The criteria for fairness and reasonableness are implied through the phrase 'arm's length pricing basis and in the ordinary course of business' (page 4, Section 14 and multiple other sections on pages 4-6), but specific criteria are not explicitly defined. Finally, while oversight mechanisms are mentioned, the details are not sufficient to definitively assess their comprehensiveness. 

Evidence 2 provides a qualitative assessment using a 1-5 scale, assigning scores of 4 or 5 to some elements but 3 for 'Criteria for Determining the Fairness and Reasonableness,' and noting that specific criteria are not explicitly defined. The overall assessment in Evidence 2 is 4 out of 5, indicating areas for improvement.

Evidence 3 acknowledges the policy's strengths but highlights several areas needing further information for a definitive score, including specific materiality thresholds, detailed procedures, and illustrative examples. The lack of these details prevents a definitive determination of comprehensiveness and well-definedness.

Overall, the evidence demonstrates that a policy exists, but its comprehensiveness and clarity are not fully established. Therefore, a score of 1 ('if policy regarding related party transactions is present but not comprehensive or not well-defined') is most appropriate."

Chandrasekaran, Mr. O.P. Bhatt, and Ms. Hanne Sorensen as board members whose appointment dates predate April 1st, 2019.  These individuals are not explicitly identified as lender representatives. Evidence 3 (page 14 of annual_report_url.pdf)  further clarifies that Mr. N. Chandrasekaran's appointment date was January 17, 2017, and although it mentions that his reappointment date is before April 1st, 2019, it doesn't specify the exact date.  However,  both Mr. O.P. Bhatt (appointment date: May 9, 2017) and Ms. Hanne Sorensen (appointment date: January 3, 2018) have appointment dates before April 1st, 2019 and reappointment dates after April 1st, 2019.  According to the scoring rubric, the presence of even one director marked as a permanent board member (based on appointment and/or reappointment dates being before April 1st, 2019) results in a score of 0, regardless of whether they are lender representatives.  Since Mr. N. Chandrasekaran, Mr. O.P. Bhatt, and Ms. Hanne Sorensen meet this criterion, the score is 0.  Evidence 2 further supports this, showing several board members with N/A reappointment dates, implying they may also be considered permanent according to the given criteria."
