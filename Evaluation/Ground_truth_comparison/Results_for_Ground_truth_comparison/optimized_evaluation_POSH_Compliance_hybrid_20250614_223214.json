The Tata Motors 79th Integrated Annual Report mentions a Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, policy (page 192).  It also provides data on the number of complaints filed under this act during FY24 (11 complaints) and FY23 (11 complaints),  also on page 192.\n\nSources: pp. 193-195 (annual_report_url.pdf); pp. 101-103 (combined_policies.pdf); pp. 5-7 (cg_report.pdf); pp. 12-14 (credit_rating.pdf)",

    "justification": "The evidence clearly indicates that Tata Motors has both a POSH policy and provides data on the number of sexual harassment incidents. Evidence 1 explicitly states that the company's 79th Integrated Annual Report, on page 192, mentions a Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, policy.  Furthermore, it reports 11 complaints filed under this act during both FY24 and FY23 (page 192).  Evidence 2 corroborates this information, stating that 11 sexual harassment complaints were reported during FY24 (Page 3 of an unspecified source, likely the same annual report or a similar document given the page number difference). The combination of evidence from both sources clearly meets both criteria for a score of 2, confirming the existence of a POSH policy and the reporting of sexual harassment incidents.
